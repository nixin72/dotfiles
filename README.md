This is where all my dotfiles and configs live. It's built with the intent of having one file that's able to handle the management of all the others. Dare I say, rule them, find them, bring them, and bind them.

The dotfiles are separated into 3 categories:
### Elves
This is where my most important configs are.

### Dwarves

### Men
