# Dotfiles

This is where my configs are for my Linux setup. No longer migrating to NixOS 
cause NixOS was a pain and there was more to learn than I was willing to put
time into.

## Basics:
- OS: Manjaro
- DE: GNOME and i3 separately
- Shell: Zsh
- Editor: Emacs
- Terminal Emulator: Alacritty

## Development tools:
- Zsh
- Emacs
- Alacritty

## Theme
- Atom-One Dark theme all around
- Zsh promp - starship
- Fira Code 

Some of these dotfiles will work on Windows or MacOS too.
Things that work on Windows:
- Emacs
- Alacritty
- VSCode 
- Zsh (when in WSL)
- git configs
- Custom browser homepage

## Recent Changes
- Replaced i3 config with a shi~~tt~~ny new one
- Replaced Fish with Zsh. I never used any of the Fish funtions I wrote anyways.
- Added new NixOS configs. These replace the install scripts cause they're redundant now.
- Going to work on making a decent, stable status bar with polybar.
